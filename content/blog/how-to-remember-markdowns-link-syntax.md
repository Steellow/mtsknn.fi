title: How to remember Markdown's link syntax
intro: |
  Was it `[label](url)` or `(label)[url]`?
  Use this weird trick to remember it &ndash; writers HATE it!

  Spoiler: it's the former since it looks like a function call.

Here I should probably write about alternative link syntaxes as well
(i.e. `<https://example.com>` and `[label][ref]`).

How about images?
