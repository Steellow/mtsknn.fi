title: Scheduled draft post

date: 2030-03-03
intro: |
  I'm a scheduled post
  because my `date` field has a future date.
  I'm also a draft
  because I'm in the `drafts` folder.

I'm visible locally (`npm start`),
but left out of the production build (`npm run build`).

Ideally the website is built and deployed (e.g. to Netlify) every day,
which would automatically take care of publishing scheduled posts.
Of course,
I wouldn't be published
because I'm also a draft.
